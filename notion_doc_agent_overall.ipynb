      "content=\"Notion is an all-in-one workspace that enables users to take notes, manage tasks, create databases, and collaborate with others. One of the key features of Notion is its ability to create and organize pages. Here‚Äôs an overview of Notion pages and their functionalities:\\n\\n### Basic Features of Notion Pages\\n\\n1. **Structure and Organization**:\\n   - **Hierarchy**: Notion allows users to create nested pages, meaning you can have a main page with sub-pages, facilitating a structured approach to information.\\n   - **Tags and Links**: You can tag pages, add links to other pages, or reference them, which helps in connecting related information.\\n\\n2. **Content Types**:\\n   - **Text**: You can add plain text, formatted text, and even code blocks.\\n   - **Media**: Pages support images, videos, audio files, and embed links from various services like Google Drive, Figma, etc.\\n   - **Databases**: You can create tables, kanban boards, calendars, or galleries directly on a page, providing dynamic organization of data.\\n   - **To-Do Lists**: Users can create checklists and to-do lists that can be managed easily within a page.\\n\\n3. **Templates**:\\n   - Notion offers a variety of templates for different use cases like project management, personal planners, meetings, and more. Users can also create their own templates for consistent use.\\n\\n4. **Collaboration**:\\n   - Pages can be shared with others, allowing for real-time collaboration. Users can comment on pages, mention others, and assign tasks.\\n\\n5. **Customization**:\\n   - Users can customize the look of pages using headers, dividers, icons, and covers. Notion also allows for the embedding of custom block types for tailored experiences.\\n\\n6. **Integration**:\\n   - Notion supports integrations with various applications and tools, allowing users to pull data from or send data to other services.\\n\\n### Use Cases for Notion Pages\\n\\n- **Personal Organization**: To-do lists, personal journals, reading lists, habit trackers, etc.\\n- **Project Management**: Keeping track of tasks, project timelines, and budgets.\\n- **Documentation**: Creating wikis or knowledge bases for teams or organizations.\\n- **CRM**: Managing contacts, leads, or sales pipelines within a database format.\\n\\n### Tips for Using Notion Pages Effectively\\n\\n- **Templates**: Make use of pre-existing templates to save time and ensure organized content.\\n- **Tags and Database Views**: Use tags and different database views to manage and visualize content in a way that works best for you.\\n- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Familiarize yourself with Notion‚Äôs keyboard shortcuts to enhance productivity while using the app.\\n- **Regular Updates**: Keep your pages updated to ensure they remain useful and relevant.\\n\\nNotion continues to evolve with regular updates and feature enhancements, so it's useful to check their official website or community for the latest information.\" additional_kwargs={'refusal': None} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 605, 'prompt_tokens': 11, 'total_tokens': 616, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_06737a9306', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='run-98db155d-8825-4970-9c67-9387fb67c7aa-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 11, 'output_tokens': 605, 'total_tokens': 616, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}\n"

    "        Each Notion Page consists of the following **Main Sections**:\n",
    "\n",
    "        1. **ChangeLog** ‚Üí A record of past modifications to the page.\n",
    "        - The **ChangeLog section** can be identified by entries in the following format:\n",
    "            \"Change Log - Date: 02/05/2025: {{id: 18be3522-3beb-80bb-9ed9-db0db98e9c3b}}\"\n",
    "        - Each entry contains a **date** and a **unique identifier (UUID)** that tracks modifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "        2. **Latest Notes** ‚Üí Contains multiple **topics related to the project**.  \n",
    "        - All content under this section **belongs to Latest Notes**.  \n",
    "        - These topics are structured **hierarchically** and follow a numerical outline format.  \n",
    "        - The **ChangeLog** will have its own numbering (e.g., **2, 3, 4, etc.**) and is separate from **Latest Notes**.  \n",
    "        - If **Latest Notes** starts at line **6**, then topics will follow a hierarchical structure:  \n",
    "            - **Topics:** 6.1, 6.2, 6.4, etc.  \n",
    "            - **Subtopics under topics:** 6.1.1, 6.1.2, 6.2.1, 6.2.2, 6.4.1, 6.4.2, etc.  \n",
    "        - Each topic represents a **key discussion point from past meetings**.  \n",
    "        - **If a topic name needs to be modified, ensure that the new topic name is clear, concise, and does not contain lengthy sentences.**  \n",
    "        - The topic name should be **short, relevant, and to the point**, avoiding unnecessary details.  \n",
    "\n",
    "        3. **Action Items (within Latest Notes)** ‚Üí The last part of the **Latest Notes** contains actionable tasks written in:\n",
    "        - **Sentence format** (e.g., \"Update the API documentation.\")\n",
    "        - **Bullet points** (e.g., \"- Finalize testing for module X.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "        ---\n",
    "\n",
    "        ### **How You Should Analyze and Compare the Data**\n",
    "        - Compare **each topic in Latest Notes** with the corresponding topic in **Latest Meeting Summary**.\n",
    "        - Identify **inconsistencies, missing updates, or outdated information**.\n",
    "        - If the **Latest Meeting Summary** provides updates for a specific topic, modify the **Latest Notes** accordingly.\n",
    "        - When modifying **topic names**, ensure they remain **concise, clear, and understandable** without lengthy explanations.\n",
    "        - Analyze the **Action Items list** from the meeting summary and ensure **relevant action items** are present at the **end of Latest Notes**.\n",
    "\n",

Bhoopendra Sharma emphasized the importance of breaking down tasks into smaller, manageable units and closing them regularly. The team discussed the Excel project, targeting 200 new cases for next week to mature the agent and improve delivery. They also covered updates on the BlackRock project, IDP agent integration, and data store work. Senthil Kumar was tasked with completing the IDP agent integration and improving the UI for better user experience. The team also discussed infrastructure issues, including a billing discrepancy with AWS and a cleanup task for IDP that was blocked due to pending model training on pensions data.\\nShahbaaz Singh\\n- Set up a meeting with the Commerce team on Tuesday (11th)\\n- Start implementation with the classification module, then navigation\\n- Take someone from the interns to build the human-in-the-loop system\\nDiwakar Joshi\\n- Complete QA for sell-side news on Monday\\n- Implement image search functionality using browser-based solution and AI\\n- Run news agent for 200 cases (100 buy-side, 100 sell-side) for XIA next week\\nPritesh Singh\\n- Finish 40 odd cases from Excel by end of day\\n- Create a task for additional 200 cases for XIA next week\\nSenthil Kumar\\n- Connect with Sharad to get full requirements for IDP agent integration\\n- Complete IDP agent integration as a priority\\n- Implement filters and improve UI for data store work\\n- Add tasks for all ongoing work and refine existing tasks\\nTask Management and Documentation\\nBhoopendra Sharma expressed concern about the team not closing enough tasks each sprint. He emphasized the importance of breaking down tasks into smaller, manageable units (5 points or less) and closing at least one task per person per week. The team was reminded to follow the guide attached to each project for defining tasks and using the point system. Sharma stressed the impact of proper task management on performance evaluations and values assessment.\\nExcel Project Updates\\nThe team discussed progress on the Excel project. Shahbaaz Singh reported starting implementation with the classification module and navigation. Diwakar Joshi mentioned completing the pipeline for news delivery but waiting for QA on sell-side news. The team is targeting 200 new cases for next week, split between buy-side and sell-side, to mature the agent and improve delivery. Pritesh Singh emphasized the importance of this week's work in assessing the navigation capabilities.\\nImage Search Implementation\\nDiwakar Joshi reported challenges with using Google Vision API and Google Custom Search API for image search. The team decided to implement a browser-based solution using Selenium or Playwright, combined with AI for output processing. They discussed the need to ensure accurate image matching and handling edge cases, especially for sell-side scenarios.\\nIDP Agent Integration\\nSenthil Kumar reported partial progress on the IDP agent integration, mentioning interruptions due to appraisal tasks and power issues during requirement gathering. Bhoopendra Sharma emphasized the priority of this task and requested Senthil to connect with Sharad for full requirements. They also discussed improvements needed for the data store UI, including adding filters and enhancing the overall user experience.\\nInfrastructure Updates\\nShahbaaz Singh reported a billing discrepancy with AWS, where they were being charged for a higher instance type (T4.2x large) than the one they switched to (T4G.x large). He has raised a billing ticket for clarification. A cleanup task for IDP was blocked because Prabhash's team hasn't trained their models on pensions data yet.\", 'latest_action_items_data': [{'user': 'Shahbaaz Singh', 'task': 'Set up a meeting with the Commerce team on Tuesday (11th)'}, {'user': 'Shahbaaz Singh', 'task': 'Start implementation with the classification module, then navigation'}, {'user': 'Shahbaaz Singh', 'task': 'Take someone from the interns to build the human-in-the-loop system'}, {'user': 'Diwakar Joshi', 'task': 'Complete QA for sell-side news on Monday'}, {'user': 'Diwakar Joshi', 'task': 'Implement image search functionality using browser-based solution and AI'}, {'user': 'Diwakar Joshi', 'task': 'Run news agent for 200 cases (100 buy-side, 100 sell-side) for XIA next week'}, {'user': 'Pritesh Singh', 'task': 'Finish 40 odd cases from Excel by end of day'}, {'user': 'Pritesh Singh', 'task': 'Create a task for additional 200 cases for XIA next week'}, {'user': 'Senthil Kumar', 'task': 'Connect with Sharad to get full requirements for IDP agent integration'}, {'user': 'Senthil Kumar', 'task': 'Complete IDP agent integration as a priority'}, {'user': 'Senthil Kumar', 'task': 'Implement filters and improve UI for data store work'}, {'user': 'Senthil Kumar', 'task': 'Add tasks for all ongoing work and refine existing tasks'}], 'pre_existing_notion_page_data': [{'page_id': '1aee35223beb80dfa18ee38ddd9dd580', 'project_name': 'Navigation Agent Development', 'fetched_content': \"1 -

Bhoopendra Sharma emphasized the importance of breaking down tasks into smaller, manageable units and closing them regularly. The team discussed the Excel project, targeting 200 new cases for next week to mature the agent and improve delivery. They also covered updates on the BlackRock project, IDP agent integration, and data store work. Senthil Kumar was tasked with completing the IDP agent integration and improving the UI for better user experience. The team also discussed infrastructure issues, including a billing discrepancy with AWS and a cleanup task for IDP that was blocked due to pending model training on pensions data.\\nShahbaaz Singh\\n- Set up a meeting with the Commerce team on Tuesday (11th)\\n- Start implementation with the classification module, then navigation\\n- Take someone from the interns to build the human-in-the-loop system\\nDiwakar Joshi\\n- Complete QA for sell-side news on Monday\\n- Implement image search functionality using browser-based solution and AI\\n- Run news agent for 200 cases (100 buy-side, 100 sell-side) for XIA next week\\nPritesh Singh\\n- Finish 40 odd cases from Excel by end of day\\n- Create a task for additional 200 cases for XIA next week\\nSenthil Kumar\\n- Connect with Sharad to get full requirements for IDP agent integration\\n- Complete IDP agent integration as a priority\\n- Implement filters and improve UI for data store work\\n- Add tasks for all ongoing work and refine existing tasks\\nTask Management and Documentation\\nBhoopendra Sharma expressed concern about the team not closing enough tasks each sprint. He emphasized the importance of breaking down tasks into smaller, manageable units (5 points or less) and closing at least one task per person per week. The team was reminded to follow the guide attached to each project for defining tasks and using the point system. Sharma stressed the impact of proper task management on performance evaluations and values assessment.\\nExcel Project Updates\\nThe team discussed progress on the Excel project. Shahbaaz Singh reported starting implementation with the classification module and navigation. Diwakar Joshi mentioned completing the pipeline for news delivery but waiting for QA on sell-side news. The team is targeting 200 new cases for next week, split between buy-side and sell-side, to mature the agent and improve delivery. Pritesh Singh emphasized the importance of this week's work in assessing the navigation capabilities.\\nImage Search Implementation\\nDiwakar Joshi reported challenges with using Google Vision API and Google Custom Search API for image search. The team decided to implement a browser-based solution using Selenium or Playwright, combined with AI for output processing. They discussed the need to ensure accurate image matching and handling edge cases, especially for sell-side scenarios.\\nIDP Agent Integration\\nSenthil Kumar reported partial progress on the IDP agent integration, mentioning interruptions due to appraisal tasks and power issues during requirement gathering. Bhoopendra Sharma emphasized the priority of this task and requested Senthil to connect with Sharad for full requirements. They also discussed improvements needed for the data store UI, including adding filters and enhancing the overall user experience.\\nInfrastructure Updates\\nShahbaaz Singh reported a billing discrepancy with AWS, where they were being charged for a higher instance type (T4.2x large) than the one they switched to (T4G.x large). He has raised a billing ticket for clarification. A cleanup task for IDP was blocked because Prabhash's team hasn't trained their models on pensions data yet.\", 'latest_action_items_data': [{'user': 'Shahbaaz Singh', 'task': 'Set up a meeting with the Commerce team on Tuesday (11th)'}, {'user': 'Shahbaaz Singh', 'task': 'Start implementation with the classification module, then navigation'}, {'user': 'Shahbaaz Singh', 'task': 'Take someone from the interns to build the human-in-the-loop system'}, {'user': 'Diwakar Joshi', 'task': 'Complete QA for sell-side news on Monday'}, {'user': 'Diwakar Joshi', 'task': 'Implement image search functionality using browser-based solution and AI'}, {'user': 'Diwakar Joshi', 'task': 'Run news agent for 200 cases (100 buy-side, 100 sell-side) for XIA next week'}, {'user': 'Pritesh Singh', 'task': 'Finish 40 odd cases from Excel by end of day'}, {'user': 'Pritesh Singh', 'task': 'Create a task for additional 200 cases for XIA next week'}, {'user': 'Senthil Kumar', 'task': 'Connect with Sharad to get full requirements for IDP agent integration'}, {'user': 'Senthil Kumar', 'task': 'Complete IDP agent integration as a priority'}, {'user': 'Senthil Kumar', 'task': 'Implement filters and improve UI for data store work'}, {'user': 'Senthil Kumar', 'task': 'Add tasks for all ongoing work and refine existing tasks'}], 'pre_existing_notion_page_data': [{'page_id': '1aee35223beb80dfa18ee38ddd9dd580', 'project_name': 'Navigation Agent Development', 'fetched_content': \"1 -
